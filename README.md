 Hi There!!ðŸ‘‹ Fellow Business Analyst Enthusisast,

 I am Rishi. I'm from Chennai, Tamil Nadu where I completed my UG in Mechanical Engineering and worked in "ZF RANE Automotive Pvt Ltd" close to Chengalpet. I was part of the Marketing team , as an associate Program Manager handling CRM and ensuring deliverables and much more for OEMS like TATA and Mahindra.

At one point, I found myself to be more inclined towards Strategic Decision Making, Problem Solving and finding ways to think and handle business problems. Identifying, Analysing anD Solving a situation, Deriving isights, finding trends and patterns and being able to understand them gave me a different feeling of joy which I loved!.

Hence, I chose to skill myself up and learn more!!. I took up my PG journey at O.P Jindal Global University with the course "Global MBA with Business Analytics". The world of AI, Machine Learning, Data Visulisation, Neural Networks and much more has been fun and welcoming!, and I know is just the beginning of much more in terms of my career and technological Advancements in the World.

I aim to understand and interpret these concepts and apply it in different business domains to allow me to add value in the  companies so that they make better decisions,short and long term.  

This Git-Hub Repo is a collection of different projects I have undertaken over my journey in becoming a "Business Analyst" and is an honest representation of my learning, understanding and Implementation.

So please do take your time and enjoy my work!!
